# 1. Use Cases

## 1.1 Analyze GitHub Repository

**Actors:** System, User (by request)

**Goals:** To automatically generate a comprehensive summary and analysis of a GitHub repository, including its purpose, structure, and core functionalities. This should be done while respecting GitHub's API rate limits and considering potential budget constraints.

**Trigger:** A request to analyze a specific GitHub repository (either explicitly by a user or triggered by another event).

**Basic Flow:**

1. **Fetch Repository Metadata:** The system retrieves the repository's basic information (owner, name, description, etc.) from GitHub.
2. **Check for Existing Analysis:** The system verifies if a recent analysis of the repository already exists in the database. If so, and the analysis is considered up-to-date, skip to View Repository Wiki.
3. **Handle Rate Limiting (Initial Check):** The system checks its current rate limit status with the GitHub API. If nearing the limit, it may delay further requests or prioritize based on available budget (see sub-use case 1.2).
4. **Fetch Repository File Tree:** The system retrieves the hierarchical structure of files and directories within the repository, respecting rate limits.
5. **Analyze with LLM (RAG):** The system processes the retrieved data using an LLM with RAG to understand the repository's code and structure.
6. **Store Analysis:** The generated analysis, including summaries and key information, is stored and associated with the repository, along with a timestamp.

**Postconditions:**

- A detailed analysis of the repository is generated and stored, potentially with limitations based on rate limits or budget.
- The analysis can be used to create a user-friendly wiki page.

**Exceptions:**

- **Invalid Repository/User:** The provided GitHub URL or user is not valid or does not exist.
    - The system informs the user that the repository or user could not be found.
- **GitHub API Rate Limit Exceeded:** The system has exceeded the allowed number of requests to the GitHub API.
    - The system will pause the analysis and resume after a specified time when the rate limit resets. Logs error.
- **Budget Constraints:** The analysis is limited due to budget considerations (e.g., limiting the number of files fetched or the depth of analysis).
    - The system will not analyze if it reached the budget to analyze the repo. (LLM cost, DB cost etc.)

## 1.2 View Repository Wiki

**Actors:** System, User

**Goals:** To allow users to view the generated wiki page for a specific GitHub repository.

**Trigger:** A user requests to view the wiki for a repository.

**Basic Flow:**

1. **Retrieve Wiki Data:** The system checks if an analysis (wiki) exists for the requested repository.
2. **Generate Wiki (if needed):** If no wiki exists, the "Analyze GitHub Repository" use case is triggered. If the budget does not allow it and generates error log.
3. **Display Wiki:** The system presents the wiki information to the user in a readable format. The code will be displayed like canvas (OpenAI’s canvas feature) and explain the codebase step by step with highlighting.

**Postconditions:**

- The user can view a comprehensive overview of the repository, including its purpose, structure, and key features.

**Exceptions:**

- **No Wiki Data Available:** No analysis data is available for the requested repository, and the system cannot generate it due to budget limitations or other errors.
    - The system informs the user that no wiki is available and may suggest analyzing the repository if the budget allows.
- **Rate Limiting Prevents Wiki Generation:** The system is currently unable to analyze the repository to generate a wiki due to GitHub API rate limits.
    - The system informs the user and suggests trying again later.

# 2. Workflow for Code Summarization

]
```

## 2.3 Crawl the files (Code) of the Repository

Retrieve the file of the repository by providing the repo owner, the name of the repo, hash of the given commit to refer the file, full file path including the filename

### 2.3.1 Information to fetch

- file (Plain text or any format based on file extension)

### 2.3.2 Example

```
Hello World!
```

## 2.4 Use LLM with RAG to summarize information

### 2.4.1 Document Splitter

Splitting document based on the code provided. This is to request LLM to provide correct line number for specific code block.

[How to split code | 🦜️🔗 Langchain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/code_splitter)

```jsx
// Provided example from https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/code_splitter/
// From
const JS_CODE = `
	function helloWorld() {
	  console.log("Hello, World!");
	}

	// Call the function
	helloWorld();
`;

// To
[
  Document {
    pageContent: 'function helloWorld() {\n  console.log("Hello, World!");\n}',
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 2, to: 4 } } }
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: "// Call the function\nhelloWorld();",
    metadata: { loc: { lines: { from: 6, to: 7 } } }
  }
]
```

### 2.4.2 Prompting

Enforce LLM to give the insight of the codebase.

[String Prompt Template](https://js.langchain.com/docs/concepts/prompt_templates/)

### 2.4.3 Schema

Ensure the LLM outputs in a predefined JSON format

[Schema using Langchain with Zod](https://js.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/types/structured/)

### 2.4.4 Prompt + Schema

Give instructions through prompting and ask llm to output based on the defined schema.

## 2.5 Folder Summarization

After summarizing all the files, we will give all the children files and folders summarization to the LLM, asking to summarize again about it's duty. This will go on recursively from the bottom to the root hierarchy.

# 3. File Structure (Core Logic)

- Agent
    - LLMProvider
    - Prompt
    - Document Splitter (Code Splitter)
    - Schema (Forcing JSON schema)
- Service
    - Recursively retrieve folders and files, and summarize the content.
- GithubRepo
    - File Retriever
    - Repo Dataclass
- DB
    - Check if User given Repo Exists
    - Input the created researched Wiki
    - Retrieve DB
    - Save Repo to DB

# 4. DB Modelling

### Branch

Represents a specific branch/commit of a repository. The `ai_summary` contains the LLM-generated overview of the entire repository.

### Folder

Hierarchical folder structure within a branch. Key fields:

- `ai_summary`: LLM-generated summary of the folder's purpose
- `usage`: Brief description of how this folder is used
- `dependency_graph`: Mermaid diagram showing relationships between files

### File

Individual code files with their content and analysis:

- `ai_summary`: LLM-generated explanation of the file
- `usage`: Brief description of the file's role
- `dependencies`: JSON array of imported modules/files

### Topics & RepositoryTopics

Many-to-many relationship for GitHub repository topics/tags.
